This is a program to recover C header from DWARF info. It works well but currently it has some problems:

3. Most type declaration has a declare file named 
4. Sometimes a subprogram can have zero lexical block, but still have inlined_subroutine as its children, since the brace are generated by the lexical block, the function output will have to function body braces, add back the brace in these edge cases.
5. It currently not working with class. In a class_type the children can be subprogram as method or member as field. Both field and method can have `accessibility` to indicate public, private or protected. The subprogram will not have much info, instead somewhere later there will be subprograms where `specification` points back to these subprogram. One of its formal_parameter will be called `this` which can be skipped
6. When a struct or an enum is defined on line a, its last member is defined on line b, and another typedef that typedef it is on line c, if line b and line c seems close enough (lets say within 20 lines), you should merge them. For example:
```
struct mpeImage { //77
    unsigned char** imageData; //79
    int bpp; //80
    int width; //81
    int height; //82
    GLuint type; //83
};

typedef struct mpeImage mpeImage; //84
```
can be merged as 
```
typedef struct mpeImage { //77
    unsigned char *imageData; //79
    int bpp;
    int width;
    int height;
    GLuint type; //83
} mpeImage; //84
```
